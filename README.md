# library_management

A typical online library management system needs to be built using Node JS and Mongo DB.

This example demonstrates how to use Express 4.x and Passport to authenticate admin using a username and password.

$ git clone https://github.com/eeshdarthvader/library_management.git
$ cd library_management
$ npm install

Start the server.

$ node server.js

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to see the example in action. 
Log in using username 'admin' and password 'testing'.
